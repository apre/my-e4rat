 * To log events use the following macros:
 *    error (format, ...)   Error Condition. Cannot continue.
 *    warn  (format, ...)   Something stupid happen. Continue executing.
 *    notice(format, ...)   Results of a succeeded task.
 *    info  (format, ...)   Messages during a task.
 *    debug (format, ...)   Debug messages.
 *
 * According to loglevel and verbose messages will be send
 * to syslog or will shown on screen.
 *
 * Queue Messages in Logging::queue if syslog daemon is not running.
 * This helps to read logging events at early startup process. To
 * indicate syslogd is running test for existence of /dev/log.
 * Usually syslogd does not remove /dev/log when they terminated.
 * It's your own fault if you stops syslogd manually and wonder of
 * lacking log events.
 * 
 * Error and Warning messages will be send to stderr,
 * others to stdout.
