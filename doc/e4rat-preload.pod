=head1 NAME

e4rat-prealod - Preload files into memory

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<e4rat-preload>  B<[> option(s) B<]>  file(s)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

e4rat-preload transfers files into memory to gain a high cache hit rate. 
The list I<file(s)> must be in a format generated by e4rat-collect.
It assumes that all files got reallocated by e4rat-realloc at first. 

In order to prevent disk seeks the preloading process is divided into two steps.
First, it reads the files' I-Node information. In the second step, it reads the files' content. This can be done in parallel of executing the command specified with --execute. If e4rat-preload is executed as the init process by adding it to the kernel parameters, /sbin/init is called.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item -V --version

show version information and exit.

=item -h --help

display usage message and exit.

=item -v --verbose

increment verbosity level.

=item -q --quiet

set verbosity level to 0. This means that no messages will be displayed.

=item -l --loglevel <number>

set loglevel to <number>. All log messages are either send to Kernel log (see dmesg(1)) or syslog(3).

=item -x --execute <command>

As soon as I-Node preloading is done, execute <command>. Reading file content into the page cache in parallel.

=item -s --sort

sort files by their physically position. Inserts the device id and I-Node number if they're missing. 

=item -o --output [file]

write sorted file list to output file. If filename is not supplied, it is written to the stdout.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=head2 Accelerate program startup time of Mozilla Firefox:

e4rat-preload /var/lib/e4rat/firefox -x firefox

=head2 Accelerate the boot process:

Run e4rat-preload as early as possible. It is recommended to run it as the init process.
To do so, append the following line to the Kernel parameters in grub(8) or lilo(8):
   init=/sbin/e4rat-preload

=head1 FILES

F</etc/e4rat.conf>
     E4rat configuration file.
